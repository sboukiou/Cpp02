# Cpp Module 02 (Cpp02)

This repository contains the exercises for Cpp Module 02. The primary focus is on implementing a small fixed-point number class (`Fixed`)


  - Fixed.hpp / Fixed.cpp — simple fixed-point arithmetic implementation
  - Point.hpp / Point.cpp — immutable 2D point using Fixed
  - main.cpp — simple tests for the implementation
  - Makefile — build helper

Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler supporting C++98/C++11 (project written in a C++98 style; GCC or Clang recommended)
- make

Build & Run
1. Open a terminal and change into the exN directory:
   cd exN

2. Build:
   make

3. Run the produced executable:
   ./Fixed
